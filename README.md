## Prior words

The goal of this repo is to build a Python documentation API for PatStat2016a. This is meant to be a temporary repo for dev. 

Ultimately, the output and functions will be part of the open PatStat2016a. Actually, this is already the case but the current version is still incomplete.

## Current (main) issues

1. Variable documentation is incomplete whenever it exceeds 1 page in the original pdf.
2. The documentation display in notebooks does not survive preview

## Desirable features

- Provide a way to  quickly  visualize table interdependencies
- Provide a library of standard SQL query for getting started (see for example de Rassenfosse, G., Kracker, M. & Tarasconi, G., 2017. "Getting Started with PATSTAT Register". Australian Economic Review 50(1), 110-120 and de Rassenfosse, G., Dernis, H. & Boedt, G., 2014. "An introduction to the Patstat database with example queries". Australian Economic Review 47(3), 395-408.)
